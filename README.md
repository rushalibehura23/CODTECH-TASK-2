Html file-

This HTML code is for a Weather App
•	It has a head section that contains information about the page, like the title and a link to a stylesheet (style.css) that makes the page look nice.
•	It has a body section that contains the content of the page.
•	The body section has:
•	A heading that says "Weather App".
•	A form where you can enter a city and click a search button.
•	A place to display a weather icon.
•	Three empty sections to display temperature, weather information, and hourly forecast.

•	Makes two API calls to OpenWeatherMap: one for current weather and one for hourly forecast
•	Calls the displayWeather() and displayHourlyForecast() functions to display the data
displayWeather() function
•	Displays the current weather data, including:
•	City name
•	Temperature (in Celsius)
•	Weather description
•	Weather icon
•	If the API returns an error, displays an error message
displayHourlyForecast() function
